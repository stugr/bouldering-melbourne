## Five minutes with ... The Crux, a new gym in Coburg North.

#### Could you tell us about the gym?
The Crux started as a "what if" conversation between two best friends - Aaron and Asama. Fantasising about our ideal space, turned into (countless) nights (after our day jobs) pouring over spreadsheets, turned into warehouse hunting, which turned into getting all our family and friends on board to help us build something beyond our wildest imagination. Now, with our head route setter, Thara, and a gun staff on board, we plan to create a space that makes climbing available to everyone. At The Crux, we want to blend these ideas with music, art and workshops to create a unique experience to inspire and energise everyone who walks in.

#### Could you tell us about the climbing?
We worked closely with [Climb ICP](https://www.facebook.com/climbicp/) to design walls that are both exciting to climb and beautiful to look at. Our setting team sees a climbing gym as a playground to experiment and explore movement and to see what is possible with human motion. Our walls have a lot of angle changes to keep our climbs interesting and varied. Prominent features of the gym include an arch, a cave section and a 4 meter high mega volume.

#### What else will the Crux provide?
The Crux prides itself on being more than climbing walls - it's a space for people to come together and explore their interests, whatever they may be. We'll have a variety of classes, starting with yoga and expanding to meditation, dance and other physical workshops. We're excited to include a co-working space for when you need to get stuff done and still want to go for a climb. Of course, there'll be delicious coffee available all day. And as we grow, we'll be taking on more community suggestions to make our space awesome.

#### Is there anything else we should know about the Crux?
We're dog friendly! Please bring dogs! Climbers need to be aged 12 and over (with exceptions for exceptional experience). The Crux is on a one-way street, so please enter from Charles St. If there isn't any parking, there is a 2hr car park at Coles. We're an inclusive space for climbers from all walks of life. If you have any ideas for making The Crux awesome, we'd absolutely love to hear from you.

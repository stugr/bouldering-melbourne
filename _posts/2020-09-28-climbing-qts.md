#### Could you please say a bit about ClimbingQTs?
ClimbingQTs is an LGBTQ+ social climbing community and advocacy group based in Naarm \[Melbourne\]. All levels are welcome from beginner to advanced and events range from monthly meet-ups, inclusive indoor climbing sessions and multi-day outdoor adventures. At the heart of ClimbingQTs values is creating an inclusive, diverse and empowering environment where LGBTQ+ folk can be their true selves, learn new skills, participate in active social sport and connect with the outdoors. ClimbingQTs members do not need to identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community however must identify as allies to the community and invest a personal interest in fostering inclusive environments for all.

#### Could you tell us something about this history and origins of ClimbingQTs?
As a collective, ClimbingQTs came together after identifying the value of fostering and expanding self-respect of non-normative gender and sexual identities. This initiative aims to promote understanding by advocating for and creating trans and queer friendly climbing spaces and events. Queer sport spaces can be a welcome refuge from heterosexuality and cissexism as well as place of comfort. Given the heteronormativity of athletics and sport culture, ClimbingQTs aims to create a space for this community to grow and diversify.

#### What plans and projects is ClimbingQTs working on now -- whether during lockdown, or for as and when restrictions might ease?
We're taking this time to focus on strengthening our relationships with climbing organizations and businesses to better support a whole community approach when we emerge out of lockdown. So definitely keep an eye on our Instagram and Facebook as we have some exciting projects up our sleeves. Something we can share if that we'll be launching in New South Wales in October this year with the support of BlocHaus Bouldering and their Marrickville space.

## Five minutes with ... Climb Mechanics

#### Can you tell us about your backgrounds, as climbers and trainers?
[Garry A Williams](https://www.facebook.com/groups/610286689170812/user/217700497/), (aka. Coach Garry): I started climbing 15 years ago with sport and trad but have fallen in love with bouldering and analysing climbing technique. My previous life was as a biomedical researcher so I love geeking out about muscle physiology and biomechanics. As well as a coach, I'm a routesetter for Northside Boulders so I love puzzles and the process behind them. My favourite feeling comes from the process of achieving something that at first seemed impossible, and coaching let's me share that with other climbers.

[Justin Foo](https://www.facebook.com/groups/610286689170812/user/518677783/): I've been a personal trainer for 8 years now. Besides the usual strength work that I help my clients with, I also specialise in injury prevention and rehabilitation. I've been a climber (primarily bouldering) for the last 13 years. It wasn't until just 5 years ago that I realised that climbing more does not really equate to climbing stronger and that's when I really thought about applying what I know through work into my own climbing training and it's great to be able to share these discoveries with others.

[Hakan Akkus](https://www.facebook.com/groups/610286689170812/user/541620337/): I have a background in exercise science and am also a personal trainer. I have been working in the fitness industry for 15 years. My focus has been in strength and conditioning, rehab, mobility and movement quality. I started climbing 6 years ago and developed a real passion for it. It has consumed me and has become my primary sport and focus. (much like most of you reading I expect!) I really enjoy utilising my background in exercise to help people improve their strength, movement, mobility and most importantly performance for climbing.

#### What services does Climb Mechanics provide?
The three of us have differing backgrounds and skills but work together cohesively to help with your climbing goals. Our Services include: Climbing coaching and movement; Strength and conditioning; Mobility; Exercise prescription for injury rehabilitation; Nutrition.

#### Can you tell us a bit about the history of Climb Mechanics?
Climb Mechanics started with the realisation there was a need for more information about training for climbing. Strength and conditioning is a relatively new concept in climbing compared to other sports, athletes recognise the importance of S & C for injury reduction, improved strength, power and performance. We thought that we could introduce these ideas to the climbing community. Justin and Hakan initially started with some weekend workshops which then evolved to boulder bootcamp. These were mostly focused on exercise prescription and injury rehabilitation. We recognised the need for beginners to not only get strong but the importance of learning excellent climbing technique, so we started some climbing basics workshops which were well received.
Just before COVID hit Garry joined our team. His experience not just in climbing but his expertise in coaching fits very well with our approach and we feel that our audience will connect well with him.
As coaches we are psyched to learn more about how climbing works and go down deep rabbit holes of discussion about it.

#### Finally, what's in the future for Climb Mechanics?
Going forward, we're going to putting out climbing training related content online through instagram and our facebook page. When gyms re-open post COVID, we will resume beginner boulder bootcamp as well as launching advanced boulder bootcamp. The advanced sessions will include technique tips beyond the beginner level and will be an opportunity to learn from each other, peer teaching and sharing psyche.
We look forward to communicating and seeing you all in future. If you have any questions or need help staying in shape during these strange times please send us a message.
